This Haskell code attempts to use a `Maybe` value directly in a function that expects an `Int`. This will result in a runtime error because the `Maybe` type represents the possibility of a missing value.  If the `Maybe` value is `Nothing`, the program will crash.

```haskell
myFunction :: Int -> Int
myFunction x = x * 2

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let maybeValue = Just 5
  let result = myFunction maybeValue  -- This line will cause an error
  print result
```
